## Knowledge Card Service

Artsdata Knowledge Card Service (also called 'Preview service') provides embeddable HTML previews of entities (for example artists) directly in a user interface. This API is consumed along with the Reconciliation Service, by tools like [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org) where you can roll-over Artsdata.ca IDs (for example artists) and get a preview of information (photo, occupation, nationality, ISNI) to help with disambiguation. Documentation provided by the [W3C Entity Reconciliation Community Group](https://reconciliation-api.github.io/specs/latest/).
