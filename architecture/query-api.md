Query API
--------------

The Query API is an API server (built with RAILS) that acts as a gateway between the ouside world and the Artsdata Triplestore.

It offers SPARQL and traditional RESTful GETs (and GraphQL in the works). 

The main goal of the Query API is to provide easy access to all data in Artsdata.ca.

Documentation coming.
