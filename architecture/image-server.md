Server for images using the International Image Interoperability Framework - [https://iiif.io](https://iiif.io)

Quote: "The IIIF is anchored by well defined Application Programming Interfaces developed and vetted by an open and rigorous community process."

This server is for **past events** so we can archive the images from events that have passed and their web pages are no longer online. At the moment, and until an event is past, the knowledge graph uses the "live" URL of the image from the source website.
