# Good Practices for Selecting `schema:performer` Values

## Overview

This document presents a set of good practices for selecting values to populate the [`schema:performer`](https://schema.org/performer) property in the context of performing arts event data. It is based on the Artsdata team’s ongoing work with cultural organizations and developers across the Canadian performing arts sector.

The goal is to improve data consistency and discoverability for live performance events, especially in promotional use cases.

## Why this guidance is needed

While properties like `schema:location` or `schema:organizer` are relatively easy to populate—thanks to limited options and dropdowns—`schema:performer` is more complex. It often requires a nuanced understanding of the performance and its structure, especially in multidisciplinary and ensemble-based genres like dance, orchestral music, or theatre.

Cultural workers may hesitate to populate this property due to:

- Ambiguity around what counts as a "performer"
- Lack of predefined lists
- Uncertainty around prominence or naming conventions

These guidelines aim to reduce friction and offer clarity.

## General Guidelines

### 1. Align with Public Presentation

Select performer values that match how the show is described to the public:

- Check the title, subtitle, and description on the event web page.
- Use the name(s) of artists or companies highlighted in promotional materials.

### 2. Main Entities on Stage

As a general rule, `schema:performer` should include the main entity or entities physically performing on stage during the event.

### 3. Use `schema:Role` for Clarity

If more than one performer is relevant (e.g., headliner and opener), use [`schema:Role`](https://schema.org/Role) to clarify their respective roles.

#### Example:

```json
{
  "performer": [
    {
      "type": "Role",
      "roleName": "Headliner",
      "performer": {
        "type": "PerformingGroup",
        "name": "Main Band"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Role",
      "roleName": "Opening Act",
      "performer": {
        "type": "PerformingGroup",
        "name": "Up-and-coming Band"
      }
    }
  ]
}
