Event additionalTypes

Follow this Airtable [link](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inv7TAAGFXS1OVAMA&inviteToken=ec46b4c087d56c761d1c61919629b529c7b1479446e4036f28e2de6275fe432b&utm_source=email) to view the Artsdata controlled vocabulary for event types and sub-types and the mapping to other vocabularies. 

This is a Work In Progress. The Artsdata controlled vocabulary of event types is used in addition to the schema.org Event types.  Each event in Artsdata has a schema.org Event type as well as an Artsdata.ca Event type.  The Artsdata.ca Event type is modelled using SKOS and linked to the event instance using the schema:additionalType property.
