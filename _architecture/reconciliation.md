The Artsdata.ca Reconciliation Service can be used to link entites to Artsdata.ca IDs. Supported entites include People, Organizations, and Places. In the future Performing Arts Productions and Works will be added. This API follows the documentation provided by the [W3C Entity Reconciliation Community Group](https://reconciliation-api.github.io/specs/latest/). This API can be consumed by tools like [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org) to add Artsdata.ca IDs (for example artists) to enrich an existing spreadsheet.
