This [spreadsheet tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NacZsvFwahT3qbnksFcFEiBwK-ou5XJJzyrUyr7QUpc/edit?gid=444637066#gid=444637066) is designed to help performing arts organizations convert their event information into Schema structured data. This structured data can then be loaded to the Artsdata knowledge graph and even pasted on your own website. Structured data helps search engines and other recommendation tools to better understand your events, so that they can share them with potential audiences.

## How to Get Started  

1. Open the tool and make your own copy. Ignore the Apps File Script warning – this script needs to be copied to your version of the spreadsheet so that your event information can be converted into structured data.
2. Enter your contact information in the `“Fill This First”` tab.
3. Already using an in-house spreadsheet for your event and performance data? Go to the `“Import”` tab to learn how to map your data into the tool.
4. Otherwise, watch the linked help video on `“Fill This First”` for guidance on manually adding venue and organization information related to your events. Then, do the same on the `“Event Data”` tab for the rest of your event information.

## Next Steps  

Once you’ve entered your data, you can email us your completed spreadsheet. We will upload it to the Artsdata Knowledge Graph, where it will be published under a CC0 license. This allows your data to be reused in cultural calendars and indexed by search engines.

If you want to add event structured data to your own website, you can copy the code next to each event name in the `“Code embed”` tab. Then, you can paste the codes directly onto your event pages. This process will vary depending on your website’s CMS, but should be easy. Doing so will improve your event’s visibility and signal to search engines that your site is the official authority. 

For more information about adding structured data to your event pages, visit the [Structured Data and Event Discoverability](https://www.artsdata.ca/en/resources/structured-data) page on the Artsdata website.
