[Here](http://artsdata.ca) is the website of Artsdata.ca.  The website provides a YASGUI user interface for writing SPARQL, and general info about Artsdata. This website is also a Lightweight Linked Data Server and Proxy that performs [dereferencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) for resources stored in the knowledge graph.

There is also an adminstrative section used for internal backups and data updates (running on a Huginn Rails server). These agents provide time base scheduling of administrative tasks.
