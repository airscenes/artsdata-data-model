Event Types
==========

Follow this Airtable [link](https://airtable.com/shrtyQWqYTvWihO7Y) to view the Artsdata controlled vocabulary for event types and sub-types and the mapping to other vocabularies. 

This is a Work In Progress. The Artsdata controlled vocabulary of event types is used in addition to the schema.org Event types.  Each event in Artsdata has a schema.org Event type as well as an Artsdata.ca Event type.  The Artsdata.ca Event type is modelled using SKOS and linked to the event instance using the schema:additionalType property.
