The Query API is an API server (built with RAILS) that acts as a gateway between the ouside world and the Artsdata Triplestore.

It offers SPARQL and traditional RESTful GETs (GraphQL in the works). 

The main goal of the Query API is to provide easy access to all data in Artsdata.ca.

The response can be in JSON or JSON-LD.  A user account enables persisted configurations for ranking graphs or settings for an iCalendar feed. 

Documentation coming.
