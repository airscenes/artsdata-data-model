Data Consumers use the data in Artsdata.ca to create listing sites, enrich data in their CMS, or build recommendation engines and intelligent assistants.

Google is an indirect data consumer of the Event JSON-LD published on individual web sites with the [Footlight](footlight.html) code snippet. Artsdata.ca maps to Schema.org vocabularies for this reason. 

### City of Laval

* The city of Laval in Quebec was the first data client with their own cultural calendar aggregating events from two principle websites: co-motion.ca and laval.ca. 
* The website called [Sign√© Laval](https://signelaval.com/fr/evenements) is a cultural calendar that uses Footlight CMS.
