## Adding people

Here is a [preliminary document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GsMstjpbTYBqVtbR8bM5fHmJpz4yL7PIQxrixcxlSPo/edit) on a template to add People.

Another way is to add a performing arts person in Wikidata and fill in the following required fields. Please add as much data as possible to help cases that require disambiguation.  We recommend linking social media profiles, and external global IDs like ISNI, but these are not mandatory. 

* Given name
* Family name
* Occupation
  * actor
  * stage director
  * musician
* Instance of human
* Gender
  * male
  * female
  * intersex
  * transgender female
  * transgender male
  * non-binary
* Date of birth
