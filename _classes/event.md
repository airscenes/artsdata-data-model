Event Types
==========
The Artsdata controlled vocabulary for event types.

The list of types (SKOS concepts) and the concept scheme can be viewed here [ArtsdataEventTypes](http://kg.artsdata.ca/resource/ArtsdataEventTypes).

For example, an Event can be assigned the type [http://kg.artsdata.ca/resource/PerformingArtsEvent](http://kg.artsdata.ca/resource/PerformingArtsEvent) showing narrower and broader SKOS concepts.

### How to use

The Artsdata Event Controlled Vocabulary is used along with the schema.org Event type.  An Event in Artsdata is a http://schema.org/Event (schema:Event or schema:EventSeries) and optionally an additional type from the Artsdata Event Controlled Vocabulary using the schema:additionalType property.

For example: `ex:Event1 a schema:Event ; schema:additionalType <http://kg.artsdata.ca/resource/PerformingArtsEvent> .`

### Reconciling

You can reconcile event types using the Artsdata Reconciliation Service.

To give it a try:

2. Enter the name of an event type, such as Circus
3. Click the Reconcile button

To limit the results only to the controlled vocabulary:
